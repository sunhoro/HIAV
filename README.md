# HIAV
Hurricane Image Analysis Viewer 

This Page proposes Hurricane Image Analysis Viewer (HIAV), a novel curated data storing and viewing structure. The HIAV employs processed primary labels obtained from a large-image curation framework developed in previous chapters to facilitate a more efficient and effective classification of natural disaster damage data. Moreover, manual damage assessment data is integrated with the building component segmentation mask, linking these two data types holistically and enabling a comprehensive visualization.
